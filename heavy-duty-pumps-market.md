<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-Duty Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty pumps market is primarily categorized into two types: centrifugal pumps and positive-displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational kinetic energy to move fluids and are ideal for high flow rates and low viscosity applications. They are widely used in industrial processes. In contrast, positive-displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it through the discharge. They excel in handling high viscosity fluids and are essential in applications requiring precise flow control. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
