<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urease Inhibitors Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li><li>Nitrification Inhibitor Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nitrogen fertilizer additives market primarily includes urease inhibitors and nitrification inhibitors. Urease inhibitors slow the conversion of urea into ammonia, enhancing nitrogen availability and reducing volatilization losses. This helps in optimizing nutrient use efficiency. Nitrification inhibitors, on the other hand, impede the conversion of ammonium to nitrate, minimizing nitrogen leaching and enhancing retention in the soil. Both types contribute to sustainable agriculture practices by improving fertilizer efficiency, reducing environmental impacts, and promoting healthier crop growth.</p></p>
