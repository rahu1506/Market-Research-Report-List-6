<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floating Solar Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solar-tracking floating solar panels</li><li>Stationary floating solar panels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The floating solar panels market can be categorized into two main types: solar-tracking floating solar panels and stationary floating solar panels. Solar-tracking floating panels adjust their position throughout the day to follow the sun, maximizing energy capture and efficiency. In contrast, stationary floating panels remain fixed in one position, relying on the stable sunlight exposure of their chosen location. Both types utilize bodies of water, reducing land use and improving cooling, which can enhance overall solar energy generation.</p></p>
