<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocides for Pulp and Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidizing</li><li>Non-Oxidizing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the pulp and paper market, biocides are essential for controlling microbial growth that can adversely affect product quality. The market is divided into two main types: oxidizing and non-oxidizing biocides. Oxidizing biocides, such as chlorine dioxide and ozone, work by introducing oxidative stress to microorganisms, effectively eliminating them. Non-oxidizing biocides, like isothiazolinones and quaternary ammonium compounds, act by disrupting cellular functions without oxidative processes. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring hygiene and enhancing the performance of pulp and paper production.</p></p>
