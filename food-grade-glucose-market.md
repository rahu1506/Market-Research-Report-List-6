<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Grade Glucose Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monohydrate Glucose</li><li>Anhydrous Glucose</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The food grade glucose market is primarily categorized into two types: monohydrate glucose and anhydrous glucose. Monohydrate glucose contains one molecule of water per glucose molecule, making it slightly more stable and easier to handle in various food applications. Anhydrous glucose, on the other hand, is devoid of water, resulting in a more concentrated form that offers higher purity and greater sweetness. Both types are essential in food production, influencing texture, sweetness, and preservation in a variety of products.</p></p>
