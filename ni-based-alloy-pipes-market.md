<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ni-based Alloy Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Seamless Pipes</li><li>Welded Pipes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ni-based alloy pipes market comprises two primary types: seamless pipes and welded pipes. Seamless pipes are manufactured without joints, offering enhanced strength and resistance to corrosive environments, making them ideal for high-pressure applications. In contrast, welded pipes are produced by joining flat metal strips, which can be more economical for larger projects but may have slightly lower performance in high-stress scenarios. Both types are crucial in industries like aerospace, oil and gas, and chemical processing due to their durability and resistance.</p></p>
