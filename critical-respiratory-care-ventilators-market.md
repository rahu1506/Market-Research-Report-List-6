<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Critical Respiratory Care Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Critical Respiratory Care Ventilators market consists of two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are used in critically ill patients requiring mechanical assistance through intubation, delivering controlled breaths directly to the lungs. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, employ masks or nasal devices to provide respiratory support without the need for intubation, making them suitable for conditions like COPD or sleep apnea. Both types play crucial roles in managing respiratory failure and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
