<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck EGR System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External EGR</li><li>Internal EGR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Truck EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) system reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by recirculating exhaust gases back into the engine. There are two main types: External EGR and Internal EGR. External EGR uses a separate system to redirect exhaust gases into the intake manifold, improving emission control. Internal EGR relies on engine design, such as valve timing, to retain exhaust gases within the combustion chamber, enhancing efficiency. Both systems aim to reduce emissions while balancing performance and fuel economy in trucks.</p></p>
