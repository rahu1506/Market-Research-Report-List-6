<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Highway Impact Attenuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-redirective Impact Attenuators</li><li>Redirective Impact Attenuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Highway Impact Attenuators are safety devices designed to reduce collision impact on roads. Non-redirective Impact Attenuators absorb energy by deforming upon impact, effectively stopping or slowing vehicles without altering their trajectory. They are ideal for fixed hazards like bridge piers. Redirective Impact Attenuators, on the other hand, not only absorb energy but also guide vehicles away from hazards, redirecting them to safer paths. Both types enhance road safety by minimizing damage and protecting drivers during accidents.</p></p>
